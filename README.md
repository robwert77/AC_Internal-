# AC_Internal- THIS IS NOT TO BE USED ONLINE AND IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES

This is my first internal hack using openGL

Compile the solution in x86 debug, unicode character set, and no precompiled headers, openGL lib might be needed.

Use a DLL injector

Simply inject the DLL found in the debug folder once you compile

ESP and snaplines will show
